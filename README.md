# Project 1: Behaviour Cloning:

In this project i have trained the car on one road using car simulator, and by using deep learning method (CNN) with NVIDIA model with keras having performance evoluator as Mean Square Error and Optimizer as Adam trained a model.

# Project 2: Detect Traffic Signs:

Took a german traffic sign data from the source:
https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs/get/a11dc223e390.zip

And trained a model on 43 Sign names used CNN using Keras to create a model. 

Optimizer: Adam

Permormance Evoluator: categorical_cross_entropy (As output label is a multiclass)
